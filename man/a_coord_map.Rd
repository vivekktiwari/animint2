\title{Map projections.}
\usage{
a_coord_map(projection = "mercator", ..., orientation = NULL, xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL)

a_coord_quickmap(xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, expand = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{projection}{projection to use, see
\code{\link[mapproj]{mapproject}} for list}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to
\code{\link[mapproj]{mapproject}}}

\item{orientation}{projection orientation, which defaults to
\code{c(90, 0, mean(range(x)))}.  This is not optimal for many
projections, so you will have to supply your own. See
\code{\link[mapproj]{mapproject}} for more information.}

\item{xlim}{manually specific x limits (in degrees of longitude)}

\item{ylim}{manually specific y limits (in degrees of latitude)}

\item{expand}{If \code{TRUE}, the default, adds a small expansion factor to
the limits to ensure that data and axes don't overlap. If \code{FALSE},
limits are taken exactly from the data or \code{xlim}/\code{ylim}.}

\description{
The representation of a portion of the earth, which is approximately spherical,
onto a flat 2D plane requires a projection. This is what
\code{\link{a_coord_map}} does. These projections account for the fact that the
actual length (in km) of one degree of longitude varies between the equator
and the pole. Near the equator, the ratio between the lengths of one degree
of latitude and one degree of longitude is approximately 1. Near the pole, it
is tends towards infinity because the length of one degree of longitude tends
towards 0. For regions that span only a few degrees and are not too close to
the poles, setting the aspect ratio of the plot to the appropriate lat/lon
ratio approximates the usual mercator projection. This is what
\code{a_coord_quickmap} does. With \code{\link{a_coord_map}} all elements of the
graphic have to be projected which is not the case here. So
\code{\link{a_coord_quickmap}} has the advantage of being much faster, in
particular for complex plots such as those using with
\code{\link{a_geom_tile}}, at the expense of correctness in the projection.
This coordinate system provides the full range of map projections available
in the mapproj package.
